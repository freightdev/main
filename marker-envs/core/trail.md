# 🧭 What is a TRAIL?

**TRL** stands for:
**Trail**


A **TRAIL** is the **path left behind** by a `MARKER` as it reads and executes `MARKS`.
It is a **log**, a **footprint**, a **breadcrumb path** — silently tracking what was followed, when, and how.


> A **TRAIL** is not for running — it's for remembering.
> It is the shadow left behind by a marker
> It only records execution.

## Core Purpose:

A `.trl.md` file:

- Captures the **order and history** of `MARK` reads
- Allows the system to trace **what was followed**
- Leaves behind an **invisible record** unless wrapped in a `RIB`
- Enables **introspection** and **timeline recovery**

---

## Example:

- `system.trl.md` – Logs all kernel-level marker movement
- `boot.trl.md` – Logs all boot-phase marker paths
- `agent.trl.md` – Logs agent-specific trace data

---

## 🧠 Philosophy:

- **Markers** generate trails automatically during execution
- Trails are **read-only**, raw, and unordered unless cached in a `RIB`
- You can inspect trails, but **you cannot rerun them directly**
  (Only a `RIB` makes a `TRAIL` executable)
