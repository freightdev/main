# 🖋️ What is an INKSTROKE?

**INKSTROKE** is a token-based unit of **creative execution**.
It represents a **measured stroke** made by a `MARKER` using `INK`.

> “A STROKE without INK is invisible.
> An INKSTROKE without purpose is noise.”

## 💡 Definition:

An **INKSTROKE** defines:

- **How much ink was used** to make a mark
- **What kind of motion** the marker performed (e.g., draw, write, render)
- **What style** the marker uses (e.g., cursive, minimal, pictographic)
- **What the stroke represents** (word, symbol, line, intent)

---

## ⚙️ System Behavior:

An `.inkstroke.md` includes:

- **stroke_id**: unique ID for the stroke
- **marker**: the agent or user who made it
- **style**: e.g., `cursive`, `print`, `pictograph`
- **scope**: how many characters or symbols the stroke covers
- **ink_used**: amount of ink consumed (configurable quota system)
- **ink_type**: e.g., `standard`, `visual`, `emotive`
- **created_at**: timestamp

---

## 🎨 Creative Philosophy:

- Every marker has a **stroke style**.
- Every stroke has a **meaning**, whether word, emotion, or shape.
- The more **rich or stylized** the output, the more **ink** is consumed.
- **Strokes are programmable**, but they are also expressive.

---

## 🪙 Ink Economy:

- **INK** is the currency of the MARKER world.
- Markers **spend ink** to leave trails.
- Users can define how many **strokes per task** are allowed.
- **Premium INK** allows high-quality, expressive, or extended strokes.

---

## 🔁 Examples:

- `cowgirl.summary.mrkr` may define:
  - 1 stroke = 1 pose
  - 3 strokes = 1 action sequence
  - 20 strokes = full drawing trail
- `summary.inkstroke.md`:
  - style: narrative
  - ink_used: 3.2ml
  - scope: 14 words

---

## 🧠 Principle:

> “A STROKE reveals the soul of the MARKER.
> INK is the cost of expression.
> Control the strokes, and you control the narrative.”
