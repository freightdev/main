# 📍 What is a MARKER?

**MRKR** stands for:
**Marker**

A **MARKER** is the only thing that can **see, read, and act** on a `MARK`.  It is the **lens, parser, or reader** that gives life to marked memory. It interprets `.mrk` files and turns static references into **active awareness**.

> A MARKER is not just a tool — it’s **sight**.
> Without a MARKER, a MARK is **just a file**.
> Without a MARK, a MARKER is **just scanning blindly**.

## Core Purpose:

A `.mrkr.md` file describes:

- What **types of MARKs** this marker can interpret
- Sets the **logic or path** to interpret marked data
- Defines **how** to read `.mrk` marks
- What **actions** to perform when a MARK is found
- Lets BEATs **see** what otherwise lies invisible
- How to follow the **trails**, **bets**, and **beats** a MARK points to

Without a **MARKER**, marks are meaningless.

## 🧠 Philosophy:

* A **MARK** is a signal.
* A **MARKER** is the interpreter, not a person.
* It’s a **reader of rhythm, pointer of memory, executor of flow**.
* **Together**, they form memory with motion.
