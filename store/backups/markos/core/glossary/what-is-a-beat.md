# 🥁 What is a BEAT?

**BEAT** stands for:
**Behavior, Execution, Attention, Tempo**

A **BEAT** is a **runtime actor** — a trained agent or unit that operates on rhythm and rule. It **executes** actions while following a defined **BET** (Beat Engine Tempo). Every BEAT listens, aligns, and acts within the tempo it's bet to follow.

> A BEAT does not define itself.
> It **performs** what the system has marked.

---

## Core Purpose:

A `.beat` file contains:

- The **behavioral script** for a given process
- The **execution logic** that matches the current tempo
- The **attention focus** — what the BEAT listens for
- The **tempo** of how and when it acts

Think of a BEAT as a live performer in sync with the rhythm of the system.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy:

- A **BEAT** is **alive** only if it follows a **BET**.
- A BEAT that drifts from its tempo **breaks the system’s trust**.
- BEATs are **disposable** — but **valuable** when in sync.

---

## Examples:

- `boot.beat` – Runs the system boot process.
- `agent.beat` – Controls a runtime agent’s behavior.
- `recovery.beat` – Handles fallback execution during failure.
- `train.beat` – Defines the motion pattern of a learning loop.

> “A BEAT without tempo is chaos.
> A BEAT with tempo becomes the pulse of the system.”
