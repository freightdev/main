# 🛰️ What is an AGENT?

**AGENT** stands for:
**Autonomous Generator Executing Nested Tasks**

An **AGENT** is a **self-directed entity** inside the MARK Kernel that initiates, plans, and executes tasks by working with `MARKER`s, `ACTOR`s, and `BEAT`s.

> An AGENT is the **mind**.
> A MARKER is the **eye**.
> An ACTOR is the **body**.

---

## 🧠 Core Role:

An AGENT is **goal-driven** and **tempo-aware**.
It is responsible for:

- Parsing `.mark` files as instructions
- Reading `bet` contracts to know what rules apply
- Delegating runtime work to one or more `ACTOR`s
- Leaving behind `trail`s and optionally wrapping them in `ribbon`s
- Syncing with `pulse`, `tempo`, `delay`, and `clock` signals

---

## 🧬 AGENT Behavior Loop:

\[AGENT] → reads .mark → scans for markers
→ checks .bet → loads .beat
→ spawns ACTORs → syncs to clock
→ leaves trail → emits echo

## 📦 Example AGENT Files:

| File Name            | Description                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `agent/loader.agent.md`     | Loads initial system configuration     |
| `agent/echo.agent.md`       | Handles echoing logs or sync output    |
| `agent/user.agent.md`       | Responds to user-initiated requests    |
| `agent/system.agent.md`     | Manages global system decisions        |

## 🎓 Traits of an AGENT:

- **Autonomous**: Makes decisions based on marks and rules
- **Coordinated**: Works with actors to perform complex routines
- **Tracked**: Leaves trails with optional ribbon access
- **Accountable**: Operates under a defined BET

---

## 📖 Philosophy:

> "An AGENT that cannot read a MARK is blind.
> An AGENT that breaks a BET is rogue."

An AGENT is a **navigator**, not a performer.
It **guides execution**, checks tempo, and ensures everything plays in harmony.

## 🧩 Related Concepts:

- `actor.md` – Performs the work
- `beat.md` – Defines the runtime rhythm
- `bet.md` – Rule contract to obey
- `marker.md` – Tool for reading marks
- `trail.md` – Execution footprint
- `ribbon.md` – Access wrapper for trails
