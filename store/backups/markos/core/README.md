## 🧠 System Name
<!-- Define the system's name and its intended identity -->

---

## 🧭 System Purpose
- What is this system for?
- Who or what interacts with it?
- What makes this system different from others?

---

## 🧱 Core Components
### `.mark` – Kernel Logic
- Define what `.mark` controls
- What must be inside?
- How do agents or tools use it?

### `.mrk` – Executable Marks
- What types of `.mrk` exist?
- How are they structured?
- What executes or interprets them?

### `.mrkr` – Markers
- What are these files for?
- When are they created?
- How are they picked up or used?

### `.beat` – Beat Format
- What is a beat?
- What does it contain?
- How is it assigned or synced?

### `.mtp` – Mark Trail Paths
- What qualifies as a book or trail?
- How does `.mtp` get created?
- What is the relationship to `.md`?

### `.mstp` – Storytelling Paths
- What does this file define?
- What role does it play in a repo?
- What is required inside it?

### `.markdb` – Memory Storage
- What goes into this file?
- Is it temporary, permanent, or both?

---

## 📚 Book Structure
- What is a “book” in this system?
- How is a `.md` file upgraded into a `.mtp`?
- What rules should exist for writing usable `.md` files?

---

## 🛠 CLI Commands
- `mark init` — what should it generate?
- `mark story` — what does it look for?
- `markbook` — what happens on book creation?
- Any other commands?

---

## 🧩 Folder Conventions
- Where do books go?
- Where do marks go?
- Where do markers go?
- Where is the kernel?
- Do agents have access to certain folders only?

---

## 🧬 Agent Behavior Rules
- How do agents discover files?
- What order do they look in?
- What beats can they run?
- How do agents bind to tools?

---

## 🔐 Licensing & Ownership (Optional)
- Is this private, licensed, or free?
- What terms (if any) should be followed?

---

## 🌀 Trails
- How is a trail created?
- What lives inside `.trl` and `.rib`?
- How are trail snapshots managed?
- Do agents write back to trails?

---

## 🧠 Philosophy
- What beliefs power this system?
- What makes this different from AI systems?
- What does memory mean here?
- What does truth look like in this architecture?

---

## 🧾 Definitions
- Create a glossary of key terms
  - Beat =
  - Mark =
  - Marker =
  - Trail =
  - Kernel =
  - Book =
  - Agent =

## 🧰 Things to Finalize
- [ ] CLI base behavior
- [ ] File format examples
- [ ] What’s required to build a new system
- [ ] Agent bootstrap rules
- [ ] How a `.md` becomes `.mtp`
- [ ] How beats are created and assigned
- [ ] Trail recovery rules
- [ ] Book validation rules
- [ ] Monorepo orchestration logic
- [ ] How a system becomes "runnable"
