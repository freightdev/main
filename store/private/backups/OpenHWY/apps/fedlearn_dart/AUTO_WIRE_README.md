# Auto-Wire Generator Results

This file was automatically generated by the Flutter Auto-Wire script.

## What Was Generated

1. **lib/main.dart** - Entry point
2. **lib/app.dart** - App widget with router
3. **lib/router.dart** - Manual route configuration
4. **lib/router_generated.dart** - Auto-discovered routes
5. **pubspec.yaml** - Updated with required dependencies

## Next Steps

### 1. Review Generated Files
Check the generated files and customize as needed.

### 2. Update router.dart
Replace the Placeholder widgets with your actual screens:

```dart
import 'features/home/presentation/screens/home_screen.dart';

final router = GoRouter(
  initialLocation: '/',
  routes: [
    GoRoute(
      path: '/',
      builder: (context, state) => const HomeScreen(),
    ),
    
    // Add discovered routes
    ...generatedRoutes,
  ],
);
```

### 3. Initialize Services
Update `main.dart` to initialize your services:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  await LocalStorageService.init();
  await SecureStorageService.init();
  
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

### 4. Add Providers (if using Provider package)
Wrap your app with MultiProvider:

```dart
return MultiProvider(
  providers: [
    ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (_) => AuthProvider()),
    // Add more providers
  ],
  child: MaterialApp.router(
    routerConfig: router,
  ),
);
```

## Convention-Based File Discovery

The script discovered:
- Screens: Files ending with `_screen.dart` or `_page.dart`
- Providers: Files ending with `_provider.dart`

## Re-run the Script

Run `./flutter_autowire.sh` anytime you:
- Add new screens
- Add new providers
- Need to regenerate boilerplate

## Backup

Your original `pubspec.yaml` was backed up to `pubspec.yaml.backup`
