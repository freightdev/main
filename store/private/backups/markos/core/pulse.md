# 💓 What is a PULSE?

**PULSE** stands for:
**Primary Unit of Loop Signal Emission**

A **PULSE** is the **smallest measurable signal** emitted by the MARK Kernel to indicate life, continuity, and timing.
It is the **atomic tick** that every CLOCK, BEAT, TRAIL, and SYNC aligns to.

> Without a PULSE, there is no rhythm.
> Without rhythm, there is no MARK.

## 🔁 Core Purpose:

A PULSE represents a single unit of time, energy, or permission inside the system.

Each PULSE:

- Advances the CLOCK
- Moves the TEMPO forward
- Allows BEATS to execute
- Updates TRAILS and triggers SYNC checks
- Is counted and logged for every live MARK cycle

## 🧬 Pulse Anatomy:

| Component | Role                                  |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| `tick`    | Numerical index of the pulse           |
| `origin`  | Which CLOCK emitted the pulse          |
| `scope`   | What layers are affected (agent, system, etc) |
| `delay`   | How long the pulse took to travel      |
| `echo`    | Optional feedback from BEATS or MARKERS |

---

## 📁 Pulse Files:

- `system.pulse.md` – Core heartbeat cycle for the MARK Kernel
- `boot.pulse.md` – Initial pulses required to start up
- `agent.pulse.md` – Agent-aligned pulse contracts
- `clock.pulse.md` – PULSE emission logic and drift detection

---

## 💡 Notes:

- A PULSE can be **missed** (drift)
- A PULSE can be **amplified** (spike)
- A PULSE can be **muted** (intentional silence)

Each of these is handled by associated `sync.md`, `delay.md`, or `bet.md` systems.

## 🧠 Philosophy:

> “A PULSE is not time —
> it's **proof that time moved**.”

A single PULSE is a breath of the kernel.
Every BEAT lives for one — and prepares for the next.

## 🔄 Pulse in Action:

[CLOCK] — emits → PULSE#145
└── [BEAT] checks tempo alignment
└── [TRAIL] logs execution step
└── [MARKER] emits feedback echo
└── [RIBBON] caches result

> Without a PULSE, the system is dead.
> Without **you**, the system has no reason to pulse.
