# 🎗️ What is a RIBBON?

**RIB** stands for:
**Ribbon**

A **RIBBON** is the **caching and encoding layer** wrapped around a `TRAIL`.

Without a **RIB**, a `TRAIL` is invisible to the system — unreadable, uncacheable, and unusable for replay.

> A **TRAIL** shows the path,
> A **RIB** makes it readable and replayable.

---

## Core Purpose:

A `.rib.md` file:

- Wraps a **TRAIL** with **visibility and replay rights**
- Enables **human-readable**, **agent-usable** memory
- Caches **what happened** and **who can read it**
- Controls **access** to the `TRAIL`

---

## Format:

Examples include:

- `boot.rib.md` – Encodes the trail of the boot process
- `agent.rib.md` – Makes the agent’s movements cacheable
- `system.rib.md` – Wraps kernel-level trails with control

---

## Usage:

- A `RIB` can be **rerun** — it replays the full `TRAIL`
- A `TRAIL` **without a RIB** cannot be rerun or parsed
- `RIB`s give **mark creators** control over **visibility, access, and flow**

> A RIB without a TRAIL is a ribbon with no story.”
