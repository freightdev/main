# 🖋️ What is a STROKE?

**STROKE** is the **atomic unit of expression** inside the MARK system.
It represents a single **gesture of intent**, **token of thought**, or **unit of inked action** made by a `MARKER`.

> “A STROKE is not just what is written.
> It’s the weight, curve, and intent behind the mark.”

## 🧠 Core Concept:

A **STROKE** is the **smallest measurable action** taken when a marker writes onto a mark.

In language: a stroke could mean one word, three words, or a phrase — **defined by how much ink was used**.
In images: a stroke could be one line, a brush pattern, or a gesture drawn by a visual marker.

## 🧪 Characteristics:

| Property        | Description                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `ink_cost`      | How much ink was used to produce this stroke     |
| `tempo_weight`  | How long or intense the stroke takes to read     |
| `style`         | Cursive? Sharp? Bold? The nature of the stroke   |
| `origin`        | Which marker produced the stroke                 |
| `meaning`       | What token or message the stroke encodes         |

## 🔍 Usage Contexts:

- In `cowgirl.summary.mrkr`, a stroke might mean a phrase like:
  *"The wind scraped against her hat."*

- In a drawing marker, a stroke might be:
  *One single curve in a horse sketch*

- In AI logic, a stroke could even be:
  *One tokenized intent across a beat, e.g., `start()`, `observe()`, `report()`*

## 🧱 Foundation of a TRAIL:

Multiple **strokes** create a **trail**.
The **trail** is the sequence of every stroke laid down by a marker.

But without a ribbon (see `what-is-a-rib.md`), those strokes may be **invisible**, **unverified**, or **non-rerunnable**.

---

## 🔐 Ownership and Design:

- The **creator of the marker** defines how **long a stroke is**
- They define **how much ink** each stroke takes
- They control whether a stroke equals one word or one function

## 📜 Creative Philosophy:

> “A STROKE is the unit of truth in a world of signals.
> It’s how you shape meaning — one motion at a time.”
