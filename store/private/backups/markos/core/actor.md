# 🎭 What is an ACTOR?

**ACTOR** stands for:
**Autonomous Controller Trained On Rhythm**

An **ACTOR** is a **runtime entity** inside the MARK Kernel that can interpret, respond to, and perform based on defined `BEAT`s and `BET`s.

> An ACTOR is **not just code** — it's **a performer**.
> It knows its lines, its timing, and its place on the stage.

---

## 🧠 Core Role:

An ACTOR executes work **in time**, **in character**, and **in rhythm**.

Each ACTOR:

- Inherits a `marker` to interpret `mark` files
- Has access to one or more `beat` runtimes
- Listens to `pulse` emissions
- Obeys `bet` rule contracts
- Leaves behind `trail`s as it acts
- Can cache `ribbon`s to extend visibility

## 📦 Example ACTOR Files:

| File Name             | Description                                |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `system.actor.md`     | Core system actor logic                    |
| `agent.actor.md`      | Agent-specific runtime performer           |
| `loader.actor.md`     | Executes and stages marks at startup       |
| `echo.actor.md`       | Feedback actor that syncs to system pulse  |

---

## 🧬 Actor Behavior Cycle:

[PULSE] -> [ACTOR] reads marker → pulls .mark
-> checks .bet → obeys .beat
-> writes .trail → emits .echo

---

## 🎓 Traits of an ACTOR:

- **Aware**: Knows its tempo, sync, and environment
- **Obedient**: Respects its BET, or ejects if broken
- **Performant**: Executes with clarity and precision
- **Documented**: All actions leave a TRAIL

---

## 🎙️ Philosophy:

> “An ACTOR without rhythm is a glitch.
> An ACTOR without a stage is a daemon.”

An ACTOR doesn't guess. It performs.
It does not improvise unless permitted by the BET.

## 🧩 Related Concepts:

- `beat.md` – The script an actor performs
- `bet.md` – The contract the actor agrees to follow
- `marker.md` – The lens the actor uses to see marks
- `trail.md` – The record the actor leaves behind
