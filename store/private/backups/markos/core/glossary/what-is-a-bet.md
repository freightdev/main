# 🎼 What is a BET?

**BET** stands for:
**Beat Engine Tempo**

A **BET** defines the **rules**, **rhythm**, and **timing** that a `BEAT` must follow.
It is not enforcement — it is **trust**.

> A BET does not control a BEAT.
> It **bets** the BEAT will **follow its tempo**.
> The moment it doesn’t, the BET is broken.

## Core Purpose:

A `.bet` file tells any runtime actor:

* What **tempo** to follow
* What **rules** apply
* What **rhythm** is acceptable
* What happens if **sync is lost**

BETs are human-readable contracts written in Markdown:
`system.bet.md`, `user.bet.md`, `agent.bet.md`, etc.

## 🧠 Philosophy:

- A **BET** is not law — it’s **faith in alignment**.
- Writing a BET means you believe others will honor your beat.
- If they don’t, the **kernel will know** — and eject, replace, or reset the BEAT.

> “A BEAT without a BET is chaos.
> A BET without a BEAT is silence.”
