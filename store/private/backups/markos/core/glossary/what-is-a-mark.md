# 🪶 What is a MARK?

**MRK** stands for:
**Mark**

A **MARK** is a **semantic tag** placed on something important:
a script, a stroke, a block, a tone, a memory, a line of code, or a trigger in time.
It is what a `MARKER` sees, reads, and follows.

> A MARK does not run — it reveals.
> It marks **what should be remembered, traced, or responded to**.

## Core Purpose:

A `.mrk.md` file:

- Identifies **critical points** in a system
- Defines **agent-readable instructions** or moments
- Creates **meaningful locations** for execution, routing, or memory
- Becomes visible only when a `MARKER` scans the space
- A `MARK` is **static** until seen by a `MARKER`
- `MARK`s may contain **metadata, instructions, or references**
- No `MARKER`, no meaning — the system only reacts to what it can see

MARKs can represent:

- Words
- Blocks
- Tones
- Boundaries
- Entrances
- Errors
- Truths
- Anything meaningful that **should not be lost**.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy:

* **MARKs define potential.**
* A **MARK** is **not alive** — it must be **read** to matter.
* A **MARK** is only useful **through a MARKER**.
* Without a MARKER, marks are **invisible**.

> A MARKER without a MARK is lost.”
