# 🧪 What is INK?

**INK** is the core resource that powers every `MARKER` in the MARK System.
It represents the **energy, intent, and visibility** behind every stroke, trail, or mark left in the kernel.

> With too much ink, meaning is drowned.”

## 💡 Definition:

**INK** is the programmable **currency of creation**.

It determines:

- **How much output** a marker is allowed to generate
- **How vivid or subtle** a trail appears
- **How many strokes** a task may consume
- **How expressive** a mark is allowed to be

---

## ⚙️ System Properties:

A `.ink.md` file or an `ink` block in a trail/ribbon contains:

- **ink_id**: unique resource tracker
- **marker_id**: what used the ink
- **volume**: total ink capacity
- **ink_used**: ink consumed per action
- **ink_type**: e.g. `narrative`, `visual`, `command`, `emotive`
- **scope_limit**: how far the ink can reach or persist
- **refill_policy**: manual / auto / credit-based
- **ink_quality**: e.g. `basic`, `rich`, `gloss`, `encrypted`

---

## 💰 The INK Economy:

- Every **agent, user, or marker** has an **INK balance**
- Actions like marking, stroking, or trailing **consume ink**
- INK can be:
  - **Recharged** (manually or automatically)
  - **Purchased** (if system allows)
  - **Delegated** (one marker allows another to use some of its ink)

---

## 🧠 Creative Principle:

- **INK is trust made visible** — it's what allows others to _see_ what you've done
- Markers **must spend wisely** — trails are permanent, but ink is limited
- **High-stakes systems** may encrypt or watermark ink output

---

## 🔁 Examples:

- A marker wants to draw 5 frames:
  - Each frame = 2.0 ink units
  - 5 × 2.0 = 10.0 ink needed
- If marker only has 6.0 ink:
  - Only 3 frames render; 2 are skipped unless ink is refilled

---

## 🧾 Formats & Usage:

- `system.ink.md` — defines global ink policies
- `user.ink.md` — defines user's ink wallet and refill preferences
- `marker.ink.md` — defines ink type/style limits per marker

## 🧠 Principle:

> “The one who controls the ink,
> Controls what gets remembered.”
