# 🎼 What is a BET?

**BET** stands for:
**Beat Engine Tempo**

A **BET** defines the **rules, rhythm, and timing** that a `BEAT` must follow. It acts as the **contract**, **law**, or **tempo definition** for agents executing inside the MARK Kernel.

> A BET does not control a BEAT.
> It **bets** the BEAT will **follow its tempo**.
> The moment it doesn’t, the BET is broken.

## Core Purpose:

A `.bet` file tells any agent:

* What tempo to follow
* What rules apply
* What rhythm is acceptable
* What happens if sync is lost

BETs are written in `.md` files like `system.bet.md`, `user.bet.md`, or `agent.bet.md`, and are human-readable rule contracts.

## 🧠 Philosophy:

* A **BET** is not law — it’s **faith in alignment**.
* If you write a BET, you are trusting others to respect your tempo.
* If they break a **BET**, the kernel knows, and it can eject, replace, or reset the BEAT.

> “A BEAT without a BET is chaos.
> A BET without a BEAT is silence.”
