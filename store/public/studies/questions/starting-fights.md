Ah — when I said “starting fights,” I didn’t mean literal violence or trolling for the sake of being mean. I meant **creating engagement through controversy or strong opinions** — stuff that gets people talking, debating, and reacting.

## 🔹 What “Starting Fights” Means in Social Media

1. **Debate & Discussion**

   * Post something that challenges a common belief or norm.
   * Example: “Here’s why most productivity advice is garbage.”
   * People **comment to argue**, share their opinions, and your post gets engagement.

2. **Contrarian Takes**

   * Say something unexpected or opposite to the usual consensus.
   * Example: “Why social media gurus are lying about followers.”
   * Sparks discussion without attacking anyone personally.

3. **Provocative Questions**

   * Ask questions that force people to choose sides.
   * Example: “Would you rather delete Facebook forever or give up TikTok?”
   * Easy way to trigger replies and debate.

## 🔹 Why This Works

* Algorithms **love engagement**.
* Comments, replies, shares = signals that your post is interesting.
* More engagement = more people see your post.

## ⚫ Important Notes

* **Do not harass, threaten, or bully** anyone. That will get you banned.
* Focus on **ideas, opinions, or challenges**, not people.
* The goal is **loud discussion**, not personal drama.

⚡ **Bottom Line:**
“Starting fights” = **posting content that sparks strong reactions and debates**, which makes the algorithm push your content further.

If you want, I can give you **examples of posts that spark discussion without getting banned** — basically the “safe but viral fight” strategy. Do you want me to do that?
