Excellent questions — you're thinking about fast, reliable, developer-first workflows between machines, just like GitHub but private and under your control. Let's break it down and give you the best tool for each mode of working:
📤 1. Best Way to Send Files Back and Forth (Manually)

Use rsync — it’s fast, incremental, and battle-tested.
Example:

From Lenovo to ASUS:

rsync -avz ~/dev/myproject/ root@trainr-asus:/srv/code/myproject/

From ASUS back to Lenovo:

rsync -avz root@trainr-asus:/srv/code/myproject/ ~/dev/myproject/

✅ Handles:

    Only changed files

    Permissions

    Deletes (if --delete is added)

🔄 2. Best Way to Sync Files Instantly (Like Live Mirror)

Use mutagen. It’s like a real-time rsync, made for development. Think: Dropbox for devs, over SSH.
🔧 How It Works:

    Watches your local files

    Instantly syncs them to remote (and back, if you want)

    Over SSH

    Runs as a daemon

🧪 Setup:

brew install mutagen  # or from https://mutagen.io/

Create a session:

mutagen sync create ~/dev/myproject ssh://root@trainr-asus/srv/code/myproject

Now as you edit files on Lenovo, they’re mirrored instantly on ASUS.

✅ Super fast
✅ Auto-reconnects
✅ Way better than NFS, SSHFS, or manual rsync

You can pause/resume it too:

mutagen pause
mutagen resume

🚀 3. Best Way to Push Like GitHub (Manual "Push" to Remote)

If you want GitHub-like "push to remote", the best tool is… Git itself, but with a remote working tree.
🧠 What That Means:

    Use git as normal on Lenovo

    Push to a bare repo on ASUS

    ASUS auto-updates the working directory (like a real deploy)

🧱 Set It Up
On ASUS (once):

mkdir -p /srv/git/myproject.git
cd /srv/git/myproject.git
git init --bare

Now create a post-receive hook to auto-update the working directory:

nano /srv/git/myproject.git/hooks/post-receive

Paste this:

#!/bin/bash
GIT_WORK_TREE=/srv/code/myproject git checkout -f

Make it executable:

chmod +x hooks/post-receive

On Lenovo:

Add remote:

cd ~/dev/myproject
git remote add asus ssh://root@trainr-asus:/srv/git/myproject.git

Then push like GitHub:

git push asus master

🔥 Now ASUS will auto-checkout to /srv/code/myproject on every push.
🆚 Comparing the Three
Goal	Tool	Pros	Use When
Manual file sync	rsync	Fast, simple, low overhead	Occasionally push/pull
Live 2-way sync	mutagen	Real-time, smart sync	Active dev, frequent changes
GitHub-style push	git + post-receive hook	Commit-based, versioned, clean deploy	When you want clean project versioning
🔁 Bonus: Hybrid Setup

You can combine them:

    Use mutagen while developing (mutagen sync resume)

    Pause mutagen, then push via Git when you want a clean update:

    git commit -am "Update feature X"
    git push asus master

🧰 Want a Controller?

You can add this to your arcbox script:

case "$1" in
  sync)
    mutagen sync create ~/dev/myproject ssh://root@trainr-asus/srv/code/myproject
    ;;
  push)
    git -C ~/dev/myproject push asus master
    ;;
  pull)
    rsync -avz root@trainr-asus:/srv/code/myproject/ ~/dev/myproject/
    ;;
esac

✅ TL;DR – Use This

    Quick back-and-forth → rsync

    Live mirroring → mutagen

    Commit-and-push model like GitHub → git push to remote with post-receive hook

Let me know which style you want help automating into your arcbox or echo-ops tool, and I’ll script it for you.


You’re asking for 3 levels of file sync/dev control between your Lenovo (dev) and ASUS (compute):
🔢 Three Modes of File Sharing You Want:
Mode	Description	Best Tool
1. Send files back and forth manually	Basic copy/upload/download	scp, rsync, or arcbox sync
2. Live sync changes instantly	Auto-update ASUS when files on Lenovo change	rsync --watch, Unison, Syncthing
3. Push only when ready (like GitHub)	Manual push + versioning	git + arcbox push, or rsync --checksum wrapper
🧱 Base Setup (Shared Foundation)

Regardless of the mode, you’ll need:

    SSH access (already working)

    A consistent directory on ASUS (e.g., /srv/code/project-x)

    A clear pattern of where files live and flow

Example paths:

    Lenovo local: ~/dev/myproject

    ASUS remote: /srv/code/myproject

✅ Mode 1: Manual Send (Best for Small Copies)
🔧 Tool: scp or rsync

# From Lenovo to ASUS
rsync -avz ~/dev/myproject/ root@trainr-asus:/srv/code/myproject/

# From ASUS to Lenovo
rsync -avz root@trainr-asus:/srv/code/myproject/ ~/dev/myproject/

✅ Mode 2: Live Auto-Sync (Best for Fast Iteration)
🔧 Tool: Unison (two-way) or Syncthing (GUI) or watchexec + rsync
🏆 Best Option: Unison for Dev

Unison is made for two-way sync with speed and safety.

sudo pacman -S unison

Create profile ~/.unison/projectx.prf:

root = /home/jesse/dev/myproject
root = ssh://root@trainr-asus//srv/code/myproject
auto = true
batch = true
repeat = watch

Run:

unison projectx

✅ Automatically syncs when changes are detected.
✅ Works both ways.
✅ Super fast, low overhead.
❌ Needs manual install on both ends.
✅ Mode 3: Git-Like Push (Best for Versioned Control)
🔧 Tool: git + remote bare repo + arcbox push

    On ASUS, create a bare repo:

mkdir -p /srv/git/myproject.git
cd /srv/git/myproject.git
git init --bare

    On Lenovo, add remote:

cd ~/dev/myproject
git init
git remote add asus ssh://root@trainr-asus/srv/git/myproject.git

    Now you can:

git add .
git commit -m "update"
git push asus master

On ASUS, have a post-receive hook to auto-deploy:

#!/bin/bash
GIT_REPO="/srv/git/myproject.git"
TARGET_DIR="/srv/code/myproject"

GIT_WORK_TREE="$TARGET_DIR" git checkout -f

Place that in /srv/git/myproject.git/hooks/post-receive and make it executable.

✅ Push-based workflow
✅ Git history and branches
✅ Feels like GitHub
❌ No automatic sync — must push manually
🔄 Bonus: Hybrid arcbox push Command

Wrap any of the above (especially rsync or git) in your custom CLI:

arcbox push ~/dev/myproject

Could do:

    A dry-run diff check

    Then push via rsync or git

    Then notify you or run tests

✅ Summary: Which Mode to Use?
Use Case	Recommended
You want to send updated code manually	rsync
You want live mirroring while editing	Unison
You want full control and version history	git + bare repo on ASUS
You want a dev CLI to wrap it	Build arcbox push command

Let me know which one you want to implement first and I’ll scaffold it for you. Or do you want a hybrid controller that supports all 3 modes via command flags?
