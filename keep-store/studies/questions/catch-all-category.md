Gotcha — you basically want one **catch-all category** where every half-baked, dangerous, AI-spit-out, “still cooking” script goes, so you don’t have to scatter them across “untested,” “unsafe,” “unfinished,” etc.

The key is to pick a single, high-signal label that:

1. **Instantly warns you and future-you** not to run it blindly.
2. **Covers all states**: incomplete, experimental, maybe destructive.
3. **Scales** — so even if you dump 200 random scripts there, the meaning stays clear.

Here are some category name ideas that work as a universal bucket:

---

**🔴 Risk/Status-Driven Names**

* `sandbox/` — widely used for experimental code, clear that it’s isolated.
* `experimental/` — tells you it’s still in testing or concept phase.
* `prototype/` — suggests it’s a draft that may not even work.
* `scratchpad/` — implies “just notes and experiments,” not production.
* `volatile/` — makes you think “this could break at any time.”
* `staging/` — common in software to mean “not yet production-ready.”
* `lab/` — evokes a testing/experiment environment.

---

**⚠️ Danger-Signaling Names**

* `quarantine/` — fits for “untrusted” or “possibly harmful” code.
* `hazard/` — unmissable warning.
* `blacksite/` — “do not run unless you’re ready.”
* `danger_zone/` — same as above, with humor.
* `explosive/` — perfect if they might blow up your system.

---

**🌀 Process/Flow-Friendly Names**

* `drafts/` — generic but fits across projects.
* `wip/` (Work In Progress) — common in dev repos.
* `hold/` — simple, no assumptions, just “not ready.”
* `pending/` — implies it’s waiting for work or review.

---

If you want **one folder to rule them all**, I’d suggest:

* **If you want a *neutral but clear* name:** `sandbox/` or `experimental/`
* **If you want a *high-danger flag*:** `quarantine/` or `hazard/`
* **If you want *fun but obvious*:** `danger_zone/` or `blacksite/`

That way all your “unfinished + untrusted + unsafe + AI-draft” scripts go in one place, but the name instantly tells you how much trust to give it.

If you want, I can give you a **tiered system** so you can keep the one-folder idea but still mark **levels of danger** inside it without scattering folders again. That way you still dump them all in one bucket but know which ones are just “unfinished” vs “this will eat your SSD.”

Do you want me to make that tier system?
