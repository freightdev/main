- Tell me the proper way to create an import catcher or whatever you call it in flutter meaning that it reads the whole file finds all the all the first parts of what it needs and then it goes back into the structure and tries to look for what that file needs like it goes okay this needs to have this import oh okay well this needs to have this important and this needs to have this important and oh okay this needs to have this important but it also needs to be this right here and this right here plus I need to generate a few pieces of code to make it work plus I need to grab you know this files in the wrong spot and then this is over here this needs to be you know I just run one command and this thing just like rebuilds the whole mother f**\*\*** system what script would you build to do that type of stuff without AI I mean yeah I know AI could do that type of stuff but I'm talking about without AI you know what and I know it's hard because you don't have templates and you don't have schemas and that's a lot of how things work and how things rebuild itself you know I'm just mostly trying to understand like when it comes to actually building something that can constantly keep my structure perfect if I have an issue I push a button and it fixes the whole mother f**\*\*** thing I mean s**_ might be all over the place that's fine you know I'm not worried about certain things but I'm also worried about like my biggest thing right now is I have screens and I bet you every screen probably has its own components its own widgets and then you know you have to go into this widget and pull this out and go into this one and do this you know I need the widgets to be like okay I can declare this widget as something I can say this widget is such and such I can say though okay this widget is another such and such okay I can say this widget routes to this smart you know it's it pretty much is full when I put a widget in there I can say this widget routes to this you know this widget also has this color this widget has this size this widget has these rounded Corners this widget you know it all comes by back to okay you got core widgets in an inside the widgets it Imports all the core stuff like it Imports all the everything it pretty much creates everything inside of that widget it pretty much says okay this is what we are and this is what we can become you know and then I'm like I need to like automatically build this s_** like automatically have everything built off of one script you know that that would be two scripts like the first script would fix everything you know fix all the architecture fix all the Imports fix all the the classes make sure all the classes are proper make sure all the make sure all the routes are correct that's a big one making sure everything's connected and I know a lot of this comes down to the user but if you can build me something to actually does some s**\* like this that'd be f\*\*\*\*** perfect like I want to be able to scramble this whole thing up f**_ with all the Imports like let's say I want to delete all the Imports and then put all this s_** in random places and then I run the script and it fixes everything it puts it all back like I didn't even touch it because it knows what it needs to be you know because it reads the architecture it knows what needs to be there it knows what the classes are it knows what this needs to be it knows what that needs to be you know it automatically fixes it there is no and you know if other are if there's other Imports on there it's going to delete the Imports that aren't supposed to be there it's going to you know it it thinks for itself it's intelligent it it knows exactly what needs to happen by the way that the prompted or by the way that the script is structured you know the way that the script walks through it you know it needs to be walking through it and fixing everything and then the other script that I would like is you know like I said you know building me all the widgets correctly not building me the widgets like going into my widgets it goes into my widgets and puts the architecture that's supposed to be in there inside of there and then for that widget it goes in fines what is actually pointing to that widget you know just stupid s\*\*\* like that you know different things of way that the architecture should be not the way that oh this developer build it that way now I don't care I want it the way that it was meant to be built the way that it was properly structured how it was designed to be built you know you design it for certain pieces you design it as you design it in a certain way feature architecture you know component Architects well not components but you know screens and widgets and you know everything that needs to be is there that type of stuff
